## Lesson Summary
### Basic Markdown Elements:
# Itallics

We can make a phrase Itallic by surrounding it with underscore `_`  
For example `_this_` would become itallic.

Lets make the word 'not' and 'hard' itallic:

Writing in Markdown is _not_ that _hard!_

  
# Bold

Similarly to make the phrase **Bold** we meed to surround it with two astricks `**`  
For example `**this**` would become bold

_Sentences_  
I will **complete** these **lesson**.  


#### Itallic and Bold in a single sentence

"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie!**"



_Note_: To make a word bold and itallic at the same time `**_this_**`

**_i am bold and itallic_**




# Heading

We use `#` to make the heading  
place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want  
`#` for heading 1  
`##` for heading 2  
`###` for heading 3  
and so on
 
# Header one
## Header two
### Header three
#### Header four
##### Header five
###### Header six 



## mix and match inline styles within headers


#### Here's some words about the book _One Hundred Years_  




# Links



To create an inline link, we wrap the link text in brackets ( `[ ]` ), and then we wrap the link in parentheses ( `( )` ). For example, to create a hyperlink to www.google.com, with a link text that says, Visit google!, we would write this: `[Visit Google!](www.google.com)`.

[Search for it.](www.google.com)

_Sentence_  
[You're **really, really** going to want to see this.](www.dailykitten.com)
#### The Latest News from [the BBC](www.bbc.com/news)




## **_Reference Link_**

`Here's [a link to something else][another place].  `  
 `Here's [yet another link][another-link].`    
`And now back to [the first link][another place].`    

     [another place]: www.github.com
     [another-link]: www.google.com 


_Examples_  
Do you want to [see something fun][a fun place]?

Well, do I have [the website for you][another fun place]!

[a fun place]: www.zombo.com
[another fun place]: www.stumbleupon.com


# Images

To create an inline image link, enter an exclamation point (` ! ` ), wrap the alt text in brackets ( `[ ]` ), and then wrap the link in parentheses ( `( ) `). 

_example_  
`![A pretty tiger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tiger.50.jpg)`  

![A pretty tiger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tiger.50.jpg)


## **_Reference Image Link_**

# Blockquotes
 
 Use to drag the attention of reader . 

 To create a block quote we need to preface a line with the "greater than " caret (`>`).

 for eg :

 `> "In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in his pockets and his
  canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces over his shoulders and, picking a
  pointed salt-eaten stick out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down
  the slope of the breakwater." `


_Sentence_

I read this interesting quote the other day:

 > "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"


 Adding caret in each line of quote
 > Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most rapidly developing technologies of our time. In just a few decades, AI has gone from being a science fiction concept to a reality that is already changing our world.
 >
 >AI is being used to develop self-driving cars, create virtual assistants, and diagnose diseases.
 >
 >It is also being used to automate tasks in manufacturing, finance, and healthcare.



# Lists

 To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ). Each list item also gets its own line. For example, a grocery list in Markdown might look like this:
`*Milk`  
`*Eggs`  
`*Salmon`  
`*Butter`  
 
**_Implementation_**

 * Milk
 * Eggs
 * Salmon
 * Butter


**_Order List_**  
We just need to preface order list with numbers

For eg:

1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour

> Note : We can add itlaic , bold and or links with lists.

**_Lists with sublists_**  
 It is just same as adding list. We just have to take care of identation


* Calcus 
   * A professor
   * Has no hair
   * Often wears green
 * Castafiore
   * An opera singer
   * Has white hair
   * Is possibly mentally unwell



# Paragraphs

To make the new line we either need to add one extra line (hard breaks) or add two spaces (soft spaces) after the end of line.


**_Sentences_**

We pictured the meek mild creatures where    
They dwelt in their strawy pen,    
Nor did it occur to one of us there    
To doubt they were kneeling then.
